# Failed to find Server Action

## [Why This Message Occurred](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/failed-to-find-server-action\#why-this-message-occurred)

For security purposes, Next.js creates encrypted, non-deterministic keys (IDs) to allow for the client to reference and call the [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data). These keys are periodically recalculated between builds for enhanced security.

When self-hosting your Next.js application across multiple servers, each server instance may end up with a different encryption key, leading to potential inconsistencies.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/failed-to-find-server-action\#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

To mitigate this, you can overwrite the encryption key using the `process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Specifying this variable ensures that your encryption keys are persistent across builds, and all server instances use the same key. This variable **must** be AES-GCM encrypted.

If you are deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, you can use the feature [Skew Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection) to ensure assets and functions from the previous version are still available, even after a new version is deployed.
